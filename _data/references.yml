He constantly shows initiative and well-developed problem-solving skills that have allowed him to create several large-scale projects on his own, freelance, create his own company, and even begin working towards a Hackathon. Ryan is also extremely insightful and has helped me learn quite a bit. He has pushed everyone on the Hacksmiths team to perform their best and on schedule. I believe that Ryan will succeed and compliment any development team he joins."

I remember on more than one occasion that he would stop by my office, just to report a problem or issue that no one else (even his supervisors or those in much more senior positions) had identified. He would describe the problem, and then a proposal or solution. ...
