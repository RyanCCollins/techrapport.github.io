  - name: "Udacity"
    category: "Senior Web Developer Nanodegree"
    dates: "2016-2017"
    description: "The Senior Web Developer Nanodegree teaches bleeding edge skills to create progressive web applications, utilizing technologies that you probably have yet to hear of.  Sensor based device access, Google's Polymer library, Service Worker and others.  Taught by industry leaders, this degree focuses on teaching best practices to create offline first web applications built for the internet of things.  As a backend developer, mastering client-side development in great detail is fascinating and only serves to expand the array of technologies at my disposal.  I expect to work in a top level role at a bleeding edge company upon completion of this degree.  I am starting it in April, 2016 and will expect to receive the credential by the end of the year."

    description: "The Ruby Nanodegree track is designed to teach best practices for creating powerful web applications built on the Ruby on Rails framework.  Having experience implementing Ruby on Rails applications in my past work has been beneficial to my education, however, the Udacity Ruby track will bring me well beyond the level of an ordinary Rails developer.  The track is broken into three components: Ruby Programming, Ruby on Rails and Senior Ruby on Rails.  As of February 2016, I am working on the Ruby Programming section of the course.  Some areas of focus include: OOP Ruby Programming, Ruby Meta-programming, MVC (fat model, skinny controller), Sinatra, Test Driven Development, Active Record, Gem creation and management and low-level under-the-hood Rails development."
