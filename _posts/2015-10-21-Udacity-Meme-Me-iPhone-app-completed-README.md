Today, I finished version 2.0 of the iOS Meme-Me meme maker app.  It has been submitted and I expect it to exceed specifications.

Check out the [GitHub project page](http://techrapport.github.io/Meme-Me), or visit our [portolio site](http://techrapport.com/projects/meme-me).  Also, take a look at the [project specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2onkzN_weWmiYErhQJw1lB9-zxM-2TQ0N5bNMAaI7I/pub?embedded=true) and [project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni0X5sjS0NreQqBHJpg8Z0foAYwegfGTPPdBKTPskPI/pub?embedded=true).  Once it has been evaluated, you will be able to see it on my Udacity profile.  Contact me if you have any questions, or would like to discuss this project.

Please note that I will be releasing this app to the [iOS App Store](http://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/free-apps/) once I have completed version 3.  I will be adding many new features, including a random meme generator, Flickr integration and more.  See the ReadME.MD file below for details on the project and get in touch with me if you like it!  Also, [subscribe to my blog](http://techrapport.com/feed.xml) to get alerted about when this app will be published to the app store.

Here is a quick video of the app in use.
