##What makes a good iOS App?


Think about some of your favorite iPhone applications.  What do they do better than others?  What is different about them?  What makes them so great?

I think it is the combination of several key factors.

* User Interface/User Experience
* Delivers on Features
* Bug free!
* Frequent Updates

Let's first look into the User Interface/User Experience area, then we'll touch on each of these areas separately and provide examples where some apps excel and others fail.

###User Interface/User Experience
How many times have you read the description of an app and decided that it was worth a look, only to find that it was unusable, confusing, ugly and just down right annoying to use?  What do you do when you are faced with this scenario?  I know what I do.  I delete the app and download another that does the same thing.

You could write the best code, but without a good UI, you might as well stop!

Apple is a company that is built on the idea that design is as important, if not moreso, than performance when it comes to personal computing.  This is what has kept them relevant and what has made them excel to become the most profitable company of our generation.

Apple has done an incredible job at designing built-in design elements and implementing them into their frameworks and the iOS SDK.  They have also written a brilliant guide about how to design your iOS apps using familiar design paradigms and elements.  I suggest that every iOS developer read this [article](https://developer.apple.com/design/).  Apple is so keen on design, that they showcase the best app designs each year and give out [Apple Design Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Design_Awards) to the developers.

My favorite apps that showcase great UI/UX and great design are:

###Delivers on Features
An application is only as good as the service(s) that it provides. It's important to keep in mind that applications are used by iOS users in order for them to expand on their mobile experience. Apps are what makes the iOS platform so amazing.  You can turn the computer in your pocket into almost anything!  You can use it as a flashlight, a level, a ruler, a notebook, or for productivity tasks, such as word processing or as an audio production tool. 

Developers and their apps are the bread and butter of the iOS ecosystem.  The best apps go above and beyond to pack in as much functionality as possible to conquer the tasks that they are built to do. 

###Bug free!
While bug free software is a myth, a developer can definitely do a lot of things to avoid fatal errors and to track down bugs and squash them when they arise.  Implementing proper error catching techniques, offering solutions when an API isn't available for the user and accepting feedback and statistics from end users really gives the user trust in the software they buy.  If I buy an app, and it crashes the first time I open it up, I already have lost trust in that developer and will stay away from their products.  Also, I will sometimes give negative reviews when they truly are deserved and I tend to stay away from apps with low reviews.


###Frequent Updates
The best apps stay relevant over time by frequently updating their code to fix bugs, enhance performance and to implement new features when they are available.  They also test their apps on new versions of software and make sure that their apps work on all of the platforms and versions of iOS.  I can't stand when I buy an app, only to find that it crashes because the developers abandoned it.  I also like it when I get a new device with new features, such as 3D touch on the iPhone 6S plus, and my favorite apps have already implemented the new features in innovative ways.  Developers help to shape how functionality is used and often think of new ways to use the hardware & software jam-packed into our iOS devices.  For example, the most exciting games and apps that were available when the iPhone 3G came out were the ones that used the built in accelerometer.
