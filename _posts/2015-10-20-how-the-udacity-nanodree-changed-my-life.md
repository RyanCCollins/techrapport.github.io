In 2015, I embarked on a journey that would change my life.  I started taking the iOS Nanodegree through Udacity, an online MOOC (massively open onlince course) provider.  At the time, I was just looking to expand my knowledge and make better iPhone apps.  What I didn't know at the time was that it would cause a chain reaction that would push me so much further than I could ever anticipate in my pursuit of academic acheivement.

###My story

I worked for many years as adeveloper, mostly working with C# & VB.NET along with SQL Server.  I worked on developing several large-scale applications that are used extensively to this day.  During that time, I was also slowly chipping away at my Master's degree.
