In 2015, I embarked on a journey that would change my life.  I started taking the iOS Nanodegree through Udacity, an online MOOC (massively open onlince course) provider.  At the time, I was just looking to expand my knowledge and make better iPhone apps.  What I didn't know at the time was that it would cause a chain reaction that would push me so much further than I could ever anticipate in my pursuit of academic acheivement.

###My story

I worked for many years as adeveloper, mostly working with C# & VB.NET along with SQL Server.  I worked on developing several large-scale applications that are used extensively to this day.  During that time, I was also slowly chipping away at my Master's degree.

In 2015, I started taking an online Nanodegree through Udacity. Udacity is a MOOC (massively Open Online Course) provider. They offer an immense catalog of courses in various technology fields and offer certifications for users for a fee.  

Udacity partners with an ever-growing list of the top technology companies in the world, including Google, AT&T, NVidia, MongoDB, et. al. to design their courses based on bleeding edge technologies that are being used in the industry right now. 

As for what a Nanodegree is, this is what Udacity has to say:

Head on over to [Udacity's Nanodegree information page](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) if you're looking for more information.

Even with their impressive publicity, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would really benefit from the experience or not. Although I had read nothing but rave reviews about Udacity, I still had to push myself to sign up. When I did, I jumped right into the coursework and quickly learned that I enjoyed it and was challenged by the lessons.  

I also noticed early on that Udacity offers more than just well thought out lesson plans, they offer you just about all of the tools that you need to succeed in the field and they gently push you towards habits that will benefit your career immensely. Not only that, they offer tremendously helpful career resources and guidance.  

I think above all else, what I have benefited most from my experience at Udacity is the habits that I have begun because of the course. For example, early on in the course they recommend that you post to your blog or write in a journal when you finish a part of a lesson. I started doing this early on and realized that, not only do I really love it, I am actually pretty good at writing!  Who would've thought?

Before Udacity, I had blogged a bit, but never thought much of it. A month into the Udacity course, I had updated my personal website so that it showcases my work, résumé and my reflections in the form of a blog.  The magical thing is that none of this has felt like "work" to me. I am starting to understand the psychology behind the "gentle nudges" that Udacity gives to you to improve your professional image. I think it is really simple and brilliant.

So now, a month into the coursework, I have a new website made from some of the latest and greatest web technologies, a blog that I post to at least three times a week, a working knowledge of iOS development in swift and two more projects to add to my portfolio.  I have had one code review and am awaiting another, plus my résumé review. I have flow charted and prototyped my capstone project and begun taking the iOS API/networking course.  It doesn't just seem possible that I will level up my career, it seems like a given. 

I look forward to the future and I am extremely excited. I look forward to the day that I graduate and begin working as an iOS developer.
