Hello, my name is Ryan and I am a software developer and implementation specialist.  I have been working in the field since completing my Bachelor's degree in engineering.  My focus has primarily been on software implementation, database development and software development in C# & VB .NET.  I also specialize in mobile development, primarily on the iOS (iPhone/iPad) platform.  

I have experience leading the implementation of several large-scale web applications and have taken part in all aspects of product implementation from idea to implementation to iteration.

###Swift Experience

This blog was designed to chronicle my experience with developing applications for the iOS platform.  I focus on the Swift programming language and a variety of other topics relating to iOS development.  Please follow along and share my site if it has helped you learn anything.

### More Information

Please feel free to look over my GitHub repository for my iOS development.  Also, I love any and all feedback and would be thrilled if you were to get in touch with me.
