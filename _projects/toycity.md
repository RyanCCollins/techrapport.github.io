### Toycity 1-3

Built a Ruby application that uses Object Oriented Ruby Programming to create a command line utility for a fictitious employer.  The app parses JSON data, converts it into usable data structures which can be printed and output as a formatted report, either in the terminal or to a text file.

Built data structures, including Arrays, Hashes and Objects that manipulate the data with the most performant algorithms.  This app underwent three expert code reviews, insuring that the code is of highest quality.

The specifications for each can be found at the links below.
