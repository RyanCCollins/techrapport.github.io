The Hacksmiths API is a large-scale microservice oriented web application designed to facilitate the Hacksmiths' volunteer hackathon for social good projects.  The backend API component of the application was architected, over the course of several months, to scale along with the project.  It drives an API that provides data for a number of different clients and micro-services, including the Frontend interface, the iOS app and the ongoing volunteer projects we create for non profit organizations.

It utilizes the MVC architecture and is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).  Views are rendered using the Jade templating language, Sass, and the Foundation framework.  Many parts of this web application are not exposed to the public, but if you are interested in learning more about the project, please visit the project on Github: https://github.com/teamhacksmiths/hacksmiths-website.  The app also utilizes the Twitter and Github APIs as OAuth providers.

NOTE: As of April, 2016, this project is being incrementally rolled out.  It's a huge project, so there is a lot more to come!
