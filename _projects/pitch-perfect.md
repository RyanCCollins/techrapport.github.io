I really enjoyed making this application and I definitely went above and beyond in the process. I experimented with adding motion & touch controls for the audio playback and effects, I added several other effects (revered & delay,) I added animations, et. al.

This app showcases my early Swift design.  I followed best practices early on and without knowing very much about the Swift programming language, I did a very good job.  I have come a long way since making this application and before I am done with the iOS Nanodegree, I will go back and add Core Data, among other things, to this application.
