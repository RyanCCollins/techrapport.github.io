A scalable fullstack web application and dashboard built primarily with MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS (MERN Stack) as well as Bootstrap, JQuery, jade.  The site drives an custom RESTful API and has a professionally built and functional admin interface for managing the site's data.  
A proof of concept web application, Uhub was designed to be a community driven fullstack web application for the communities I am involved with through Udacity.  Ultimately, this application was replaced by the Hacksmiths.io web app and the Udacious People website.

Because this app is not in production, the URL will bring you to the Github page for historical reference.  If you really want to see this project, please contact me.cal reference. If you really want to see this project, please contact me.
