The official website of Ryan Collins - Fullstack Developer.

A work in progress, this website is built with Jekyll, with a Gulp / Browsersync workflow that I created.

I am using ReactJS and JQuery to build the frontend and Jekyll to generate the site.  The backend is being built with Ruby on Rails.
