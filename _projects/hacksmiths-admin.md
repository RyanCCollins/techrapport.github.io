The Hacksmiths web application / admin dashboard serves to provide a beautiful interface for the Hacksmiths project's API.

It utilizes the MVC architecture and is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).  Views are rendered using the Jade templating language, Sass, and the Foundation framework.  Many parts of this web application are not exposed to the public, but if you are interested in learning more about the project, please visit the project on Github: https://github.com/teamhacksmiths/hacksmiths-website.  The app also utilizes the Twitter and Github APIs as OAuth providers.

NOTE: As of April, 2016, this project is being incrementally rolled out.  It's a huge project, so there is a lot more to come!
