A rails web application built to chronicle my ongoing mastery of the wonderful web platform that is Ruby on Rails.  At the moment, most of this site is backend only.  The site is used to track my ongoing projects and manage tasks related to these projects.  I will be building out a bit of a frontend to give this project a front facing component.

Built with these great technologies:
Ruby on Rails
Active Record
Sass
AWS Ubunutu Web Server
OAuth
Test Driven Development
