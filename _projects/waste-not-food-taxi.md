For our kickoff event, the Hacksmiths, a group of 18 experienced software developers from 5 countries across the world, are working to create the Food Drivr website and mobile app in an effort to reduce food waste and facilitate donations of edible food in the city of Portland.  We are working with a charitable organization called the Waste Not Food Taxi in an effort to facilitate their philanthropic work through the creation of software.

Lead by Ryan Collins and Sean Craig, the Hacksmiths are a group of software developers working collaboratively with a common goal of creating software tools used by philanthropic organizations across the world.

Please stay tuned for exciting releases about this exciting project.  Follow us on Twitter @teamhacksmiths and visit our website http://hacksmiths.io to learn more!
