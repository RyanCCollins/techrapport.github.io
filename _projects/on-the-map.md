I am working on this app right now!  Keep a watch on the progress at [Waka Time](http://wakatime.com/@techrapport).  I am spending extra time with this app because I will be implementing Parse as the backend for it.  I anticipate that it will be done November 27th.

###Test the App

To run this app, please do the following:

 1.  Download it to your computer using one of the download links above, or from the [GitHub project page]({{page.project-page}}) or from my [portfolio page]({{site.url}}{{page.url}}) on the right-hand side.  
 2.  Once downloaded, open the project folder and then open the Pitch Perfect.xcodeproj file.
    - Make sure that you are testing the application on a device that it will run efficiently on (see build information on the right.)  
    - I recommend running it on an iPhone 6 or newer, but it will run fine on anything newer than an iPhone 4S.
 3.  If you are using the iPhone Simulator, please run it on a newer device such as the iPhone 6 or 6S Plus.  It should be compiled with XCode 7.0 or 7.1 in Swift 2.0.  I will update it over time when new versions of XCode are released.

Below is a short video guide to illustrate how you could build and run the app on a Mac running OSX El Capitan.

If you don't want to run it or can't for some reason, take a look at the video and screenshots below.
