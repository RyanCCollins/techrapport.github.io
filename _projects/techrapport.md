This website was built by me as a project to showcase my work.

In this project, I demonstrated that I could design and implement a website using Jekyll. The website is designed to be 100% responsive and mobile-friendly. It utilizes Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, the Liquid templating language, Ruby and much more.

The site uses SASS as a preprocessor for the CSS. It features parallax and other animation effects to showcase my design and programming skills. The site is generated using Jekyll, which converts Markdown files into HTML by passing them through templates that I created using Liquid, HTML, SASS, etc. I utilized several ruby and python plugins for this site and wrote a few of my own. The site is served to GitHub pages after it has been generated.

I used best practices when creating this website and learned a whole lot about how to properly build a site with speed and reliability in mind. I used Node.js and Grunt to monitor, verify and lint my code. I also minified all of the code, utilized precomposed images and made the site as fast and small as possible.

I also built it with search engine optimization in mind. I also added a blog and a portfolio into the site. The blog is where I post my reflections of things that I learn and tutorials for others to benefit from. I used social sharing buttons on the blog, jQuery mobile menu, and more. Please visit the project page, peruse my site and [get in touch with me](mailto: info@techrapport.com) if you have any questions.
